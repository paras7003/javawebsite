            <b>1. Object-Oriented:</b><br>
            Classes and Objects: Java is fundamentally object-oriented, meaning it revolves around the concept of classes and objects. Programs in Java
            are organized into classes, which encapsulate data and behavior.<br><br>
            <b>2. Platform-Independent:</b><br>
            Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA): Java follows the principle of WORA, which means that once you write a Java program, it can run on any device
            that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This is achieved through the compilation of Java code into an intermediate bytecode that 
            can be executed on any system with a compatible JVM.<br><br>
            <b>3. Compiled and Interpreted:</b><br>
            Compilation: Java source code is compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler. This bytecode is a platform-independent representation of the 
            program.
            Interpretation: The JVM interprets this bytecode at runtime. This combination of compilation and interpretation contributes to Java's 
            portability.<br><br>
            <b>4. Automatic Memory Management:</b><br>
            Garbage Collection: Java employs automatic garbage collection, which means that the Java Virtual Machine automatically manages memory by 
            reclaiming unused objects. Developers do not need to explicitly free memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks.<br><br>
            <b>5. Security:</b>
            Sandbox Environment: Java provides a secure environment by running Java applications in a "sandbox," which restricts the activities of the 
            program to ensure it cannot harm the host system.<br><br>
            <b>6. Rich Standard Library:</b><br>
            APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): Java comes with a vast standard library that provides pre-built modules and 
            classes for a wide range of functionalities, such as networking, file I/O, data structures, and more.<br><br>
            <b>7. Multi-threading:</b><br>
            Concurrency Support: Java has built-in support for multi-threading, allowing developers to create applications that 
            can perform multiple tasks concurrently. This is crucial for developing scalable and responsive software.<br><br>
            <b>8. Community and Ecosystem:</b><br>
            Active Community: Java has a large and active developer community. This has led to the creation of numerous libraries,
            frameworks, and tools that enhance the development process.<br><br>
            <b>9. Versatility:</b><br>
            Application Types: Java is used for a wide range of applications, including web development (Java EE), mobile app 
            development (Android), enterprise applications, scientific and research applications, embedded systems, and more.<br><br>
            <b>10. Open Source:</b><br>
            OpenJDK: Java has an open-source implementation called OpenJDK (Java Development Kit). OpenJDK is the reference 
            implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE).<br>
            Java's combination of portability, security features, and robustness has made it a popular choice for 
            developing a variety of applications across different platforms and industries. It continues to evolve with 
            regular updates and releases, ensuring its relevance in modern software development.<br><br><br><br><br>.
